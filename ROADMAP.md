# 🌌🪐 ROADMAP TO THE VEGANIC STARCIV

**"From epistemic seed bank to galactic eco-infrastructure"**

A sci-fi agrarian technological dream woven from code, consciousness, and care, powered by **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)** and **direct federal support**.

🧬 **Repository**: `foolsgoldtoshi-star/highvalleywake-pbc-galactic`  
🏗️ **Architecture**: ClojureScript DSL + Dual Build System + MMT Integration  
🚀 **Vision**: Post-industrial ecological civilization through functional programming  

⸻

## 💰 **MMT-POWERED FOUNDATION**

Inspired by **Stephanie Kelton** & **L. Randall "Randy" Wray**, this roadmap assumes **federal monetary sovereignty** for ecological transition:

🏛️ **Direct Federal Support:**
- **U.S. Department of Agriculture** - Direct veganic infrastructure funding
- **Department of Government Efficiency** - Regulatory streamlining and fast-track approvals  
- **U.S. Treasury & Federal Reserve** - Fiat dollar creation for:
  - Land acquisition programs (no artificial scarcity)
  - Infrastructure development (regenerative priority)
  - Housing construction (earth-based materials)
  - Technology development (open-source agricultural software)

💰 **Blockchain Infrastructure:**
- **USDC stablecoin payments** routed via **Solana & Ethereum** blockchains
- **ClojureScript + Babashka** library bindings for seamless crypto operations
- **Tesla integration** with **Toyota/Honda mechanic networks**
- **Self-hosted encrypted apps** replacing centralized platforms (Uber → P2P delivery)
