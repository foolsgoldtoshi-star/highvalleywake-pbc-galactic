# Corn Agronomy (No‑Till, Veganic)

**System**: Roller-crimped cover crop → no-till corn planting  
**Fertility**: 100% plant-based inputs, no animal products  
**Weed Management**: Mulch suppression + canopy closure

## Cover Crop Foundation

### Species Mix
- **Cereal Rye**: Biomass producer, weed suppression, soil structure
- **Hairy Vetch**: Nitrogen fixation, soil biology enhancement
- **Target Biomass**: 7–12 tonnes per hectare for effective mulch

### Establishment
- **Seeding Window**: September 25 – November 1
- **Seeding Rates**: 
  - Rye: 90 lbs/acre
  - Vetch: 25 lbs/acre
- **Method**: No-till drill or broadcast + light incorporation

## Termination & Planting

### Roller-Crimping
- **Timing**: Rye anthesis to soft dough stage (critical for kill)
- **Method**: Roller‑crimper creates weed‑suppressing mulch
- **Target**: >90% ground cover post‑roll
- **Same Day**: Plant corn immediately after rolling

### No-Till Planting
- **Equipment**: No‑till planter with row cleaners
- **Row Spacing**: 30 inches for equipment access in small patches
- **Seeding Rate**: 32,000 seeds/acre
- **Depth**: Uniform depth through mulch, avoid compaction

## Corn Varieties

### Selection Criteria
- **Maturity**: 95-105 Comparative Relative Maturity (CRM)
- **Drought Tolerance**: Essential for elevation and Mediterranean climate
- **Dent Corn**: Field corn suitable for nixtamalization
- **Open-Pollinated**: Consider heritage varieties for seed saving

### Recommended Types
- Drought-tolerant dent hybrids adapted to elevation
- Traditional southwestern varieties (Flint corn heritage)
- Modern hybrids with stay-green traits

## Veganic Fertility Program

### Nitrogen Sources
- **Legume Fixation**: From hairy vetch cover crop (primary)
- **Irrigation Water**: Nitrate accounting from spring/well water
- **Compost**: On-site plant material compost only
- **Prohibited**: No animal manures, blood meal, bone meal, fish emulsion

### Other Nutrients
- **Phosphorus**: Rock phosphate if soil tests indicate
- **Potassium**: Kelp meal, granite dust if needed
- **Micronutrients**: Basalt meal for broad spectrum minerals
- **Organic Matter**: Ramial wood chips (≤2" diameter branches)

## Weed Management

### Primary Strategy
- **Mulch Suppression**: Dense cover crop residue prevents weed emergence
- **Canopy Closure**: Rapid corn growth shades out late-emerging weeds
- **No Cultivation**: Strict no-till to preserve soil structure

### Backup Methods
- **Hand Removal**: Limited hand weeding at field edges only
- **Flame Weeding**: Pre-emergence option for severe pressure
- **Cover Crop Selection**: Allelopathic species for natural suppression

## Growth Monitoring

### Key Stages
- **V6**: Six-leaf stage - assess stand and early vigor
- **VT**: Tassel emergence - irrigation critical period begins
- **R1**: Silking - peak water demand period
- **R6**: Physiological maturity - harvest planning

### Stress Indicators
- **Leaf Rolling**: Water stress indicator
- **Purple Coloration**: Phosphorus deficiency or cold stress
- **Stunting**: Compaction, nutrient deficiency, or pest pressure

## Harvest & Storage

### Timing
- **Field Drying**: Harvest at 15.5% moisture if possible
- **Weather Windows**: Avoid wet conditions for field traffic
- **Quality**: Test weight and protein content for nixtamal suitability

### Post-Harvest
- **On-Farm Storage**: Aerated bins with moisture monitoring
- **Cleaning**: Remove foreign material before storage
- **Pest Management**: Monitor for storage insects (veganic methods only)

## Record Keeping

### Required Data
- **Planting**: Date, variety, seeding rate, weather conditions
- **Growth**: Weekly scouting notes, photos, measurements
- **Inputs**: All fertility and pest control materials (veganic compliance)
- **Harvest**: Yield by patch, quality metrics, storage conditions

### Analysis
- **Annual Review**: Yield trends, input costs, system improvements
- **Patch Comparison**: Identify best-performing areas and practices
- **Climate Adaptation**: Adjust varieties and timing based on weather patterns
