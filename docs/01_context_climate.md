# Climate & Seasonality Context

**Location**: Latitude ~38.8°N (Cloverdale CA equivalent) with USDA Zones 9a–9b  
**Elevation**: ~3,000 ft elevation → cooler nights and later last frost  
**Climate Pattern**: Mediterranean with dry summers, wet winters

## Frost Patterns

- **First Frost**: Typically mid–late November in lowlands
- **Last Frost**: Late February–March in lowlands  
- **Elevation Impact**: At 3,000 ft expect cooler nights and later last frost—validate locally
- **Growing Season**: Approximately 200 frost-free days

## Temperature & Heat Units

- **Corn Heat Requirements**: 95–105 CRM dent corn adapted to Mediterranean dry summers
- **Degree-Day Tracking**: Essential for timing cover crop termination and planting
- **Elevation Adjustment**: Cooler nights extend maturation period

## Water Budget

**Corn Water Use (ETc)**: California field corn requires ~23–29 inches per season
- **Planning Target**: Use ~26 inches mid‑range 
- **Adjustment Factors**: Weather, planting date, hybrid selection
- **Efficiency Goal**: Drip irrigation 90% efficiency, sprinkler 75%

## UV and Solar Exposure

- **UV Index**: Summer readings 8-10 (very high) - worker safety protocols required
- **Solar Orientation**: North-south rows preferred for even light distribution
- **Shade Management**: Map tree shade for solstices/equinoxes; exclude heavy shade polygons

## Actionable Climate Planning

1. **Variety Selection**: Drought‑tolerant hybrids for elevation and heat stress
2. **Cover Crop Timing**: Stage termination to maximize mulch depth before planting  
3. **Irrigation Scheduling**: Real-time ET calculation from on-site weather station
4. **Frost Protection**: Low-lying areas may need protection or variety adjustment

## Weather Monitoring

- **On-Site Station**: NOAA-compatible automated station for real-time data
- **Integration**: ET calculation, frost alerts, irrigation triggers
- **Data Retention**: 10+ years for climate trend analysis
