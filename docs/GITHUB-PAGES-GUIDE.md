# 🌌 The Way of GitHub Pages

*"Like water finding its way through mountain stone, the path to post-industrial civilization flows through simple, elegant code."*

## 🧘‍♂️ **The Zen of Galactic Deployment**

Dear seeker, you have found the way to the digital mountain. Here, in the realm of GitHub Pages, the ancient wisdom of functional programming meets the modern art of automated deployment.

### **🌱 The Living Site**

**The Path is Open**: [https://foolsgoldtoshi-star.github.io/highvalleywake-pbc-galactic/](https://foolsgoldtoshi-star.github.io/highvalleywake-pbc-galactic/)

*"What you see is not what you get - what you see is what becomes."*

This is not merely a website. It is a living, breathing documentation system that generates itself through the power of ClojureScript. Each page is born from functional programming principles, each build is a pure function, and each deployment is an act of creation.

## 🌊 **The Rolling Waters of Development**

*"Like a mountain stream that never stops flowing, our development branch rolls forward with the wisdom of the ages."*

### **The Branch Strategy:**

- **Branch**: `pond-highdesert` (rolling, unstable, experimental)
- **Philosophy**: "Pond high desert" - fluid, adaptive, ever-changing
- **Status**: Active development with breaking changes expected
- **Deployment**: Automatic GitHub Pages deployment on every push

### **The Deployment Flow:**

```
🌍 Code Changes (pond-highdesert branch)
     ↓ (git push)
🤖 GitHub Actions (automated build)
     ↓ (dual build system)
🌌 GitHub Pages (live deployment)
     ↓ (global CDN)
🌱 World Access (post-industrial civilization)
```

## 🎊 **The Final Wisdom**

*"May your code be elegant, your builds be successful, and your civilization be regenerative."*

The path to post-industrial ecological civilization begins with a single line of code. That line becomes a function, that function becomes a system, that system becomes an infrastructure, and that infrastructure becomes a civilization.

**The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The journey of a galactic civilization begins with a single repository.**

🌱🚀 **Ready to build the starcommons!** 🚀🌱
