# Project Overview

**Design principle**: Farm-as-ecosystem, following Atthowe's approach—optimize living relationships first; let inputs shrink as functions of biodiversity, residue cover, and soil biology. This repo encodes the design, operations, and monitoring needed to run no‑till veganic corn across scattered patches.

## Patch Logistics

**Patchwork fields**: 1–10 acre blocks demand narrow equipment, compact headlands, and distributed storage. Plan short hose runs, mobile filtration, and a nurse tank trailer to move water between micro‑fields.

## Ecological Approach

- **Helen Atthowe Principles**: Ecosystem-first design
- **No-Till Methods**: Roller-crimped cover crops for weed suppression
- **Veganic Fertility**: Plant-based inputs only, no animal products
- **Biodiversity Focus**: Insectary hedgerows, perennial strips as infrastructure
- **Water Stewardship**: On-site springs and aquifer with sustainable yield planning

## System Goals

- **Yield**: Stable grain corn yields appropriate to elevation & heat units
- **Resilience**: No‑till mulch for moisture retention and weed suppression  
- **Closed Loop**: Irrigation from on‑site springs/aquifer within legal bounds
- **Value Addition**: On‑farm nixtamalization → fresh masa, hominy, grits
- **Documentation**: Git-versioned farm management as living codebase

## Repository Philosophy

We treat the farm as both an **ecosystem** and a **codebase**: versioned, observable, and reversible. Every agronomic decision is documented, every field operation logged, and every configuration change tracked through Git.
